        <h2>RE DESIGN</h2>
    </div><!--End of topic-->

    <div id="content">
        <div id="text">
            <p>The "Re-design" project focuses on re-designing the familiar forms of everyday products. In 2000 we held
                the RE-DESIGN Exhibition, asking creators from a variety of fields to design some very ordinary
                commodities, including toilet paper and matches.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This project is neither a re-proposal of everyday objects nor a sort of gag. It was an attempt to
                present in the differences between the conventional products and these designers' proposals - the
                compelling essence of design. Although each participant was given a different design theme, they all
                came up with creative responses that brought up one question after another, somewhat compensating for
                the nascent nature of our original question.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Each of these everyday products has its own unique mode of production and history, while the creators
                have their distinct ideas about making things. Please enjoy the combination of these thoughts and
                stories, along with the actual objects.</p>
