                solitary motion, in the wake of an avalanche
            </h1>

            <h2>
                deer in the headlights, there <br>
                goes a weaker one
            </h2>

            <p>
                he's listenin' in the fast gaze, i don't care now to see the way<br>
                do you hear the silence? i was far too late
            </p>

            <p>
                oh living for the city, and it's always troubling<br>
                to keep it in the hot lane, i don't care about no scenery<br>
                and you run from it then, now you can't escape, cause it's all you see
            </p>
